## How it's made

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Netlify

 --- The page uses vanilla Javascript, HTML5, and CSS in a Bootstrap fashion. The page is responsive and built using a "desktop-first" approach.  This project gave me the opportunity to bring my embedded systems projects to the web all while learning more about front end frameworks ---

## Optimizations

--- The ability to auto deploy this site upon any changes to the main branch (production branch) ---

## Lessons learned

--- With this portfolio building task, I was able to further my tech skills and furhter understand how servers serve and JS engines bring plenty of useful functions to use within the browser. ---
